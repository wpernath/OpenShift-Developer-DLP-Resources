# OpenShift Developer DLP Resources
A Repository for the Presentations done during the Red Hat OpenShift Developer Distance Learning Program (DLP). In this DLP you are learning and understanding:

- Basic Development with OpenShift 
- Doing CI/CD with OpenShift with Tekton Pipelines
- Understanding OpenShift Templates and Kustomize 
- Doing GitOps with ArgoCD and Tekton Pipelines
- Packaging your kubernetes app as a Helm Chart or Kubernetes Operator

## Additional Reading
If you want to deepen your knowledge on several topics, have a look at the following blog series on **Automated Application Packaging and Distribution with OpenShift** which you could read here: 

- [Chapter one](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2021/04/26/automated-application-packaging-and-distribution-with-openshift-part-12/) talks about container images and explains all the basic files and gives you a guide through OpenShift Templates and Kustomize as a base technology for application packaging
- [Chapter two](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2021/05/24/automated-application-packaging-and-distribution-with-openshift-part-23/) provides an overview of the various packaging formats, namely Helm Charts and Kubernetes Operators, and explains how they differ from each other and how to create them
- [Chapter three](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2021/07/26/automated-application-packaging-and-distribution-with-openshift-tekton-pipelines-part-34-2/) gives you a detailed view of Tekton / OpenShift Pipelines and helps you to quickly start your CI/CD process
- [And finally chapter four](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2021/09/06/automated-application-packaging-and-distribution-with-openshift-gitops-and-argocd-part-44) provides a detailed overview of GitOps and how to use it with OpenShift.
